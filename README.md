  ## Steps
  1. In Calculator.java
     
     ```
      - Task 1: Write a *static* method named performCalculation with 3 parameters: 2 floating point numbers and a string. If this function is called with  2.5 , 4.5 and "-" , the method should return -2.0. If the third paramter is "+" , then perform addition, if the third parameter is "avg" calculate the mean/average of 2 numbers. Use if-else
       
     - Task 2: Write a method named performCalculation2 that does exactly the same as Task 1 but using a switch case instead of an if-else, but this method does not return any values, instead just prints the output on screen
     ```
       
  2. For Customer.java and Phone.java
     
     ```- Task 3: Perform Encapsulation on all class variables```
     
     
  3. In Customer.java
     ```
     - Task 4: Introduce 2 phone objects named as workPhone and personalPhone
     
     - Task 5: Write a method called calculateAverageBillWork that asks the user for the work phone's bill amount for every month of a year and calculates its average and returns it. Use for loop
     
     - Task 6: Write a method called calculateAverageBillPersonal that asks the user for the work phone's bill amount for every month of a year and calculates its average and returns it. Use while loop
     
     - Task 7: Write another method called calculateOverallAverage. This method :
       
         a. Calls both the calculateAverageBillWork method as well as calculateAverageBillPersonal method
       
         b. Then invokes the performCalculation method of the Calculator class to find the average of both these bill ```

4. In the Phone.java
   
   ```
    - Task  8: Introduce a static variable named emergency that has the value 911
    - Task 9: Introduce a static method called callEmergency that displays the message 'Dialing 911'.
   
   Note: Don't hard code 911, instead use the static variable that we created in Task 8

   ```
5. In Main.java

   ``` -Task 10:Test Phone, Calculator and Customer classes. This step is mandatory```
